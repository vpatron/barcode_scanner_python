"""
This uses the pyusb module to read the popular LS2208 USB barcode 
scanner in Linux. This barcode scanner is sold under many labels. It
is a USB HID device and shows up as a keyboard so a scan will "type"
the data into any program. But that also becomes its limitation. Often,
you don't want it to act like it's typing on a keyboard; you just want
to get data directly from it.

This program detaches the device from the kernel so it will not "type"
anything, and reads directly from the device without needing any device-
specific USB drivers.

It does use pyusb to do low-level USB comm. See 
https://github.com/pyusb/pyusb for installation requirements. Basically, 
you need to install pyusb:

    pip install pyusb

To install the backend that pyusb uses, you can use libusb (among
others):

    sudo apt install libusb-1.0-0-dev
    
You need to make sure your user is a member of plugdev to use USB 
devices (in Debian linux):

    sudo addgroup <myuser> plugdev
    
You also need to create a udev rule to allow all users to access the
barcode scanner. In /etc/udev/rules.d, create a file that ends in .rules
such as 55-barcode-scanner.rules with these contents:
